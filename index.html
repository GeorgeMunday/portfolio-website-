            <h2>work-experience</h2>
            <p>I worked in a small cafe in the center of town for about 2 months it wass called cafe de luca</p>
            <p>During your two months at Café Di Lucca in Knaresborough, you likely gained valuable insights into the operations of a small café. Café Di Lucca, located at Castle Court, Market Square, Knaresborough HG5 8AE, is known for its British cuisine, including breakfast, lunch, and brunch options.</p>
            <p>Working in such an environment, you would have developed skills in customer service, food preparation, and maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. Additionally, you might have learned about inventory management, handling customer feedback, and the importance of teamwork in a small business setting.</p>
            <p>These experiences are valuable for understanding the dynamics of the food service industry and can be applied to future roles in similar establishments.</p>

            <p>As a Crew Member at McDonald's, I’ve developed strong customer service skills, efficiently handling customer orders, addressing concerns, and ensuring satisfaction in a fast-paced environment. I am adept at communicating effectively, maintaining a positive attitude, and resolving issues promptly, which has helped build rapport with customers.</p>
            <p>In addition to customer service, I gained experience in food preparation and maintaining quality standards, all while adhering to safety and hygiene protocols. I’ve learned to manage multiple tasks, work efficiently during peak hours, and collaborate with my team to ensure smooth operations.</p>
            <p>I’ve honed skills in teamwork, time management, and multitasking, all of which are essential in maintaining high performance in a busy work environment. This role has helped me develop a strong work ethic, adaptability, and the ability to thrive under pressure.</p>
